"""A data-generating process for which the GIG-Poisson model is correctly specified.

The process is a photon-counting survey. There are ``K`` sites. Site ``k`` emits at an
unknown rate ``lam_k``, drawn once from a generalised inverse Gaussian law. The sensor
picks a site and a dwell time, and the detector returns a count::

    lam_k          ~  GIG(alpha_k, a_k, b_k)     (parameter, drawn once)
    y | lam_k, u   ~  Poisson( f(u) lam_k )      (observation)

with the action ``u = (k, t)`` and the exposure map ``f(u) = t * kappa_k``, in which
``kappa_k`` is the known geometric attenuation of site ``k``.

Correct specification means what it says: the sensor's prior is the law the parameter was
drawn from, and the sensor's likelihood is the law the count was drawn from. Nothing here
is an approximation to the simulator, so the analytic predictive is the exact marginal of
the process, and :func:`self_check` verifies that against the simulator rather than
asserting it.

The closed forms themselves live in ``methods/gigpoisson.py`` and are re-exported here, so
that scripts written against this module keep working.
