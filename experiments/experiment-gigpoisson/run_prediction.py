"""Prediction error against sample size, over regimes of the generating parameters.

The model is correctly specified throughout (``dgp.py`` gates that separately), so what
this measures is not bias but the rate at which the price of not knowing the rate is paid
off. Each replicate draws its own true rate from the mixing law, observes counts at unit
exposure, and is scored on how far its posterior predictive sits from the predictive an
oracle would use who knew the rate exactly.

Two error measures, both exact rather than estimated from a held-out sample:

    KL divergence   ``KL( P(y | f lam*) || p(y | u, D_n) )``, summed over the support of
                    the oracle predictive. This is the prediction error proper: it is zero
                    only when the two laws agree, and it carries no Monte-Carlo noise.

    rate error      ``| E[lam | D_n] - lam* |``, which is what Proposition 2 bounds, and is
                    reported alongside so the two rates can be compared.

Sample size is reported as the accumulated exposure ``F_n = n f`` as well as the count ``n``,
because the theory is a statement about the former. Here ``f = 1`` so they coincide, which
is the point of choosing unit exposure.

Writes to ``results/``. Figures come from ``visualize_prediction.py``.
