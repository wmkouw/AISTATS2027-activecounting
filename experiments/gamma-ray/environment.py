"""Allocating telescope time across gamma-ray sources.

A pointed observation looks at one source at a time. The instrument is a photon counter, so
the number of photons recorded in an integration is Poisson about the source's flux times
the telescope's effective area times the time on target::

    lam_k                             true photon flux of source k, from the catalogue
    u = (k, t)                        which source, and how long to integrate
    f(u) = A_eff * t                  exposure, in cm^2 s
    y | lam_k, u  ~  Poisson(f(u) lam_k)
    cost(u) = t                       budget spent, in megaseconds

That is the whole of the observing model, and it is Assumption 1 exactly: the action scales
the rate through a known constant and cannot change which source is being measured.

**What is real here.** The rates are not simulated. They are the integral photon fluxes above
1 GeV of 4557 sources in the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, and the counting process is
the one that measured them. The previous study generates its rates from the GIG-Poisson law
itself, so a model that assumes that law is correct by construction; here no model in the
comparison produced the field it is asked to learn.

**Priors are conditioned on source class, and that is where the problem lives.** A gamma-ray
observer knows what kind of object a target is before pointing at it, and the classes are not
alike: in this catalogue pulsars have a median flux twelve times that of blazar candidates
and a variance-to-mean ratio twelve hundred times larger. Giving every source the same
population prior would make the targets exchangeable, and a schedule that simply visits each
in turn would then be near-optimal by construction, leaving nothing for any acquisition to
find. Conditioning on class restores the heterogeneity that is actually there: some targets
are already well constrained by what they are, and some are not.

**No leakage.** The catalogue is split in two, within each class. One half supplies the
population an agent fits its class priors to; the other supplies the sources an episode
observes. A model therefore knows what pulsars look like in general and nothing about the
particular pulsar in front of it, which is the position a real observer is in.

**The budget is scarce relative to the target list, and that is deliberate.** Forty-eight
targets share 120 Ms, so most of them cannot be observed at all and the campaign must decide
which to leave alone. An abundant budget makes this a different problem: if every target can
be measured well whatever the schedule, the prior differences wash out and visiting each in
turn is near-optimal, so no acquisition rule can distinguish itself. Scarcity is the regime
adaptive allocation exists for, and it is the regime a real observing proposal is written in.

**Two simplifications, both stated rather than hidden.** The brightest and faintest five per
cent of the catalogue are excluded: the faint end sits at the detection threshold where a
flux-limited catalogue is incomplete, and a handful of exceptionally bright sources would
otherwise consume any budget by themselves. And there is no diffuse background. A real
observation counts source photons plus a known background, which is an *additive* term and
so falls outside Assumption 1; carrying one would need a different conjugacy argument and is
left to the discussion.
