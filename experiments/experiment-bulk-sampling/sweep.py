"""How scarce does the budget have to be before choosing where to sample matters?

The comparison in ``run.py`` is run at one budget and one number of blocks, and a single
such point turns out not to be a general statement about anything. When the budget is large
relative to the number of contexts, every block ends up well measured whatever the schedule
does, the prior differences wash out, and visiting each in turn is near-optimal: no
acquisition rule can distinguish itself, and none does. When it is small, most blocks cannot
be sampled at all and the allocation is the whole problem.

This sweep holds the budget at 240 cubic metres and varies the number of blocks that budget
has to cover, so the axis is cubic metres available per block. The question it answers is the
one a practitioner actually has, which is not "is this acquisition better" but "at what point
is it worth the trouble".

Writes ``results/scarcity_sweep.csv``. Run after ``run.py``.
