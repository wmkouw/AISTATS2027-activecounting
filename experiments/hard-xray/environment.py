"""Scheduling hard X-ray follow-up of Swift-BAT sources with a pointed telescope.

The same decision problem as the gamma-ray study, in a different sky: a focusing hard X-ray
telescope has a fixed allocation of time and a list of Swift-BAT-selected targets far longer
than it can observe well, and must decide which to point at and for how long::

    lam_k                             hard X-ray flux of target k, from the BAT catalogue
    u = (k, t)                        which target, and how many kiloseconds to integrate
    f(u) = C t                        exposure: C converts flux to counts per kilosecond
    y | lam_k, u  ~  Poisson(f(u) lam_k)
    cost(u) = t                       budget spent, in kiloseconds

**What is real.** The rates are the 14-195 keV fluxes of the 1632 sources of the Swift-BAT
105-month survey. No model in the comparison produced them.

**Why the tail is not a gamma's.** The survey is flux-limited over sources spread through
space, so its flux distribution follows the source counts: for a Euclidean population
``N(>S) ~ S^{-3/2}``, a power-law tail. A gamma mixing law has an exponential tail and cannot
follow it; a GIG of negative order has a power-law tail and can. Fitted per class on the
1-99 per cent band, every class has a negative order, between -0.3 and -3.4.

**The count scale.** ``counts_per_ks`` converts catalogue flux (1e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in
14-195 keV) to detected counts per kilosecond. Over the full 3-79 keV band a NuSTAR-like
telescope records about 31: a photon index of 1.8 puts 37 per cent of the 14-195 keV flux in
2-10 keV, and a 1 mCrab source (2.4e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 2-10 keV) gives about one count per
second in each of two modules. The default, 3.1, is the hard band above 20 keV alone: for
the same spectrum 16 per cent of the 3-79 keV photons arrive above 20 keV, where the
effective area is roughly half its peak, so about a tenth of the full-band rate. That band
overlaps the one BAT measures, and it is what hard X-ray follow-up of BAT-selected active
galaxies is designed around. At this scale a 0.5 ks snapshot of a median target records
about 22 counts.

**Priors are conditioned on source class**, fitted to one half of each class, with targets
drawn from the other half, exactly as in the gamma-ray study. Classes with fewer than 75
catalogue members are pooled into ``other``, together with the unidentified sources.

**Simplifications, as in the gamma-ray study**: no background (an additive term outside
Assumption 1), time-averaged rather than variable fluxes, and a flux-limited parent sample.
