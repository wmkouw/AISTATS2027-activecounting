"""Regenerate every results table in the paper from the recorded CSVs.

One script, so a number in the manuscript cannot drift away from the run that produced
it. Each table is written as a LaTeX fragment into ``tables/`` and pulled into

design of the study rather than its results.

Run from this directory::

Writes ``tables/bulk.tex``, ``tables/photon.tex``, ``tables/rate_fields.tex`` and
