"""One sequential campaign under one agent, scored identically for every method.

Shared by every study that compares agents head to head, so that no method is timed or
scored by a different loop than another. Written against the environment protocol of
``agents.base`` (``n_contexts``, ``action_values``, ``exposure``, ``cost``) plus the three
draws every environment offers (``blocks``, ``stone_fields``, ``held_out``).

**Timing.** Wall-clock seconds of ``agent.act`` (design selection) and ``agent.observe``
(belief update), accumulated separately and nothing else: not the environment, not the
scoring, not the initial prior fit in ``reset``. Whatever an agent caches between rounds it
is entitled to, and the cost of maintaining the cache is inside one of the two calls.

**Scores at each checkpoint.**

    nlpd          average surprisal of held-out counts at the evaluation exposure, under
                  the agent's own predictive, in nats.
    regret_top{m} simple top-m regret, m = 1..5: ``1 - sum_{k in S} lam_k / sum_{k in S*} lam_k``,
                  where ``S`` is the agent's m contexts of highest posterior mean rate and
                  ``S*`` the m of highest true rate. Scale-free, in ``[0, 1]``. The
                  posterior mean is used because it is the one point estimate every model
                  here, sampled or Laplace or conjugate, provides without approximation.
    rate_rmse     root-mean-square error of the posterior mean rate (diagnostic).
    rate_dex      the same in ``log10`` (diagnostic).
    touched       fraction of contexts observed at least once.
