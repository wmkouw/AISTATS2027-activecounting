"""Which mixing law does a real field of photon rates need?

The bulk-sampling study of the previous section generates its rates from the GIG-Poisson law
itself, so the model is correctly specified by construction and the comparison there measures
what misspecification costs rather than what the family is worth. This study removes that
circularity: the rates are 5065 gamma-ray source fluxes measured by a photon-counting
instrument, and no model in the comparison generated them.

Each candidate mixing law is fitted by maximum likelihood to the same fluxes and scored by
AIC, so the third parameter has to earn its place against the penalty.

Writes to ``results/``. Figures come from ``visualize.py``.
