"""A Poisson rate with a log-skew-normal prior, sampled by MCMC, scored by nested Monte Carlo.

The non-conjugate route the paper argues against, built the way a practitioner outside a
conjugate family would build it:

    s = log lam  ~  SkewNormal(xi, omega, alpha)     three parameters, like the GIG
    y | lam, u   ~  Poisson(f(u) lam)

**Why this prior.** It is as flexible as the GIG in parameter count: a location, a scale and
a shape that moves mass between the two sides of the log-rate, so it can put a heavy tail
on either side of the rate. It is log-concave in ``s``, so the posterior is unimodal and an
MCMC baseline fails for reasons that belong to the estimator rather than to a pathological
target. And it has no conjugate partner: the posterior is carried as a cloud of samples.

**The belief.** Summing Poissons of a common rate, the likelihood of a context's history is
``T s - F exp(s)`` in the accumulated count ``T`` and exposure ``F``, so the target is
exactly known up to a constant. The belief is ``(prior, T, F)`` plus :data:`N_CHAINS`
parallel Markov chains whose current states are the posterior sample.

**The update.** Each observation moves ``(T, F)``, and every chain then takes
:data:`N_STEPS` Metropolis-Hastings steps on the new posterior, starting from where it was.
Each step is, with equal probability, a random walk at ``2.4`` Laplace standard deviations
or an independence proposal from a Student-t at the Laplace mode. Both kernels leave the
posterior invariant, so their mixture does; the independence move is what lets a chain
that sits in the old, wider posterior reach the new, narrower one in a few steps rather than
by diffusion. The Laplace mode is found by Newton's method, which is safe because the log
target is concave.

**The acquisition.** EIG by nested Monte Carlo: half the chains supply outer pairs
``(lam_i, y_i ~ Poisson(f lam_i))``, the other half the inner evidence estimate, so the two
are independent draws of the same posterior. The estimate is biased up at order ``1/M`` and
noisy at order ``1/sqrt(N)``; both are properties of the estimator this paper replaces, and
neither is corrected here. See ``experiments/synthetic/nmc-cost``.

**What the agent is told.** The same as everyone else. Where only two moments are given
(bulk sampling), the skew is set to zero and location and scale matched in log space, which
is the lognormal moment match; a third moment is not available to anyone. Where a
population of rates is given (gamma-ray), all three parameters are fitted to its logarithm
by maximum likelihood, as each other family is fitted in its own parameters.
