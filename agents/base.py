"""What a sensing agent is: a model, a criterion, and a belief it carries itself.

Agents are written against a small environment protocol rather than against any one problem,
so the same agent runs on the bulk-sampling and photon-counting studies unchanged:
``n_contexts``, ``action_values``, ``exposure(u, recovery)``, ``cost(u)`` and
``target_exposure``. A study supplies those and keeps its own domain names beside them.

An agent is a pair. The **model** says what a count is and how a belief about a rate moves
when one arrives. The **criterion** ranks candidate actions given that belief. Varying the
first with the second held fixed asks whether the modelling choice matters; varying the
second with the first held fixed asks whether the acquisition choice matters. They are
different questions and this package keeps them separable.

The belief belongs to the agent rather than to the environment, because two agents with
different models do not carry the same kind of object: a conjugate agent carries a few
numbers and a non-conjugate one carries a grid. The environment supplies the same prior
*information* to everyone, as a mean and a variance per block, and each agent expresses that
in its own family.

Three things are fixed here rather than left to the individual agent, because varying them
would make the comparison meaningless rather than merely different:

**Cost normalisation.** The budget is spent in cubic metres, so a criterion is ranked by its
value per cubic metre. Applied identically to every criterion, ours included.

**Cache invalidation.** Beliefs factorise across blocks, so an observation at one block
changes the score of that block alone.

**Prior information.** Every agent is initialised from the same two moments and none is told
the true parameters.
