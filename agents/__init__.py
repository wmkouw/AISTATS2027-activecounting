"""Sensing agents: pairs of a count model and an acquisition criterion.

The registry below spans two axes deliberately, because they answer different questions.

**Does the acquisition matter?** Hold the model at GIG-Poisson and vary the criterion. That
is the first group, and it is where maximum entropy sampling, D-optimality, Thompson
sampling and the rest appear.

**Does the model matter?** Hold the criterion at expected information gain and vary the
mixing law. That is the second group. Every model is initialised from the same prior mean
and variance per block, so a difference between them is a difference in what the family can
express and not in what it was told.

Considered and not included: adaptive cluster sampling (Thompson, 1990), the standard design
for rare and clustered populations, which expands a neighbourhood around any unit exceeding
a threshold. It needs a spatial adjacency between sampling units to expand into, and the
blocks here are independent under the prior, so the rule has nothing to act on. It becomes
relevant once the context set is given spatial structure, which is the extension named in
the discussion.
