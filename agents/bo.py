"""Bayesian optimisation over the contexts, on a Gaussian process with a discrete output.

The baseline the manuscript does not yet have: a non-conjugate surrogate with a kernel, run
under a standard optimisation acquisition rather than an information one. The surrogate is
:class:`methods.gppoisson.GPPoisson` -- a Gaussian process over log-rates with a Poisson
observation model and a Laplace posterior -- so the output is discrete and the kernel lets a
measurement at one context move the belief at another. Every model in ``countmodels`` treats
the contexts as independent, so this is the only member of the comparison that can pool.

**What the acquisition scores.** Bayesian optimisation ranks *points*, and a point here is a
pair: which context to measure and how much of it. Expected improvement scores the context
and says nothing about the exposure, so the exposure enters as a fidelity, in the way
multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation handles it. The value of a pair is the improvement the
context is expected to offer, discounted by how much of that context's uncertainty an
observation of this exposure can actually remove,

    acq(k, v) = EI(k) * rho(k, v),
    rho(k, v) = s_k^2 e lam_k / (1 + s_k^2 e lam_k),

with ``e = f(u)`` the exposure, ``s_k^2`` the posterior variance of the latent and ``lam_k``
the posterior mean rate. The second factor is the fraction of the latent variance a Poisson
observation of that exposure is expected to retire, since its Fisher information about the
latent is ``e lam_k``. The study then divides by cost, as it does for every criterion.

**Two acquisitions, because they answer different questions.** Expected improvement is the
default. Upper confidence bound is included because it is the other standard choice and
because it concentrates differently, and the two disagree about how much to explore.

**A note on what this baseline is for.** Expected improvement optimises: it is built to find
the largest rate, not to predict counts well everywhere. It should be read against the
top-``m`` regret column first and the held-out predictive second, where it is expected to
lose to criteria that spread. That is the comparison, not a defect in the implementation.
